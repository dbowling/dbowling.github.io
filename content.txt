Kids: Due to space restrictions and in order to allow all guests, including parents, an evening of relaxation we have chosen for our wedding day to be an adult-only occasion. 

We hope this advance notice means you are still able to share our big day and will enjoy having the evening off!

We also recognize that many of our out-of-state guests are hoping for the opportunity to enjoy Montana’s beauty with their children. Therefore, we would like to connect you with babysitters in Missoula for the evening of the wedding. If you are interested in babysitting services, please call or email us at turnerandbowling@gmail.com. There will also be a space to request assistance with finding a babysitter in the RSVP field (LINK).

Things to do in Western Montana? 
So many things to do! Summer is a lovely time to visit Montana. If you’d like a list of things to do, please let us know!

We are 2.5 hours from the west entrance of Glacier National Park. This is not to be missed. GNP has become very popular in recent years, so we recommend making reservations nearby soon. LINK.
